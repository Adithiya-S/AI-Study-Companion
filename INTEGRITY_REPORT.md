## ⚠️ Action Items

### 1. **Install Python Dependencies** 📦 (Required)

**Status:** ❌ 14 packages missing  
**Impact:** High - App won't run without these  
**Solution:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Missing Packages:**
- opencv-python (camera functionality)
- mediapipe (face tracking)
- numpy (numerical operations)
- pandas (data analysis)
- pillow (image processing)
- matplotlib (charts/graphs)
- pygame (sounds)
- plyer (notifications)
- google-generativeai (AI assistant)
- python-dotenv (environment variables)
- PyPDF2, python-docx, python-pptx, openpyxl (document parsing)

**Time Required:** 2-5 minutes (depending on internet speed)

### 2. **Python Version** 🐍 (Highly Recommended)

**Current Version:** Python 3.13.7  
**Status:** ⚠️ Critical Warning  
**Required:** Python 3.11  
**Impact:** High - Camera features will NOT work with Python 3.13+

**Why Python 3.11 Specifically?**
- MediaPipe (eye tracking) is NOT compatible with Python 3.13+
- Camera features will fail or crash
- Python 3.11 is the sweet spot for all dependencies
- Extensively tested and verified to work

**Solution:**
1. **Download Python 3.11:** https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/
2. **Install alongside Python 3.13** (don't uninstall 3.13)
3. **Use the py launcher:** `py -3.11 main.py`
4. **Or use provided script:** `run_python311.bat`

**Time Required:** 5 minutes

## 🚀 How to Get Everything Running

### Quick Start with Python 3.11 (Recommended)

**Step 1: Get Python 3.11**
If you don't have Python 3.11, download it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
py -3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3: Run the App**
```bash
py -3.11 main.py
```
Or double-click `run_python311.bat`

**Step 4: Enjoy!**
- All features work perfectly! 🎉

### Alternative: Use Automated Setup

```bash
setup.bat
```
This will automatically find Python 3.11 or use the best available version.

### Alternative: Java Launcher

```bash
run_launcher.bat
```
The Java launcher automatically detects and uses Python 3.11.

---

### ⚠️ If You Must Use Python 3.13

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Limitations:**
   - ❌ Camera will NOT work
   - ❌ Eye tracking will NOT work
   - ✅ All other features work (AI, sessions, materials, analytics)

**Seriously though, just use Python 3.11.** 😊

## 📋 Test Checklist

Before deploying or using, verify:

- [x] All files present
- [x] Directory structure correct
- [x] API key configured
- [x] Java launcher compiled
- [ ] **Python dependencies installed** ← Action needed
- [x] No syntax errors
- [x] `.gitignore` protects `.env`
- [x] Data directories initialized

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'"
**Solution:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue: Camera not working
**Solution:** 
1. **You MUST use Python 3.11!** Python 3.13 breaks MediaPipe
2. Download Python 3.11: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/
3. Run with: `py -3.11 main.py` or use `run_python311.bat`
4. Check if camera is in use by another app
5. Run integrity check: `py -3.11 check_integrity.py`

### Issue: Java launcher won't run
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure Java is installed: `java -version`
2. Recompile: `javac StudyCompanionLauncher.java`
3. Run batch file: `run_launcher.bat`

---

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

### Regular Checks (Monthly)
- Run `python check_integrity.py` to verify system

- Backup `data/` folder (sessions and materials)

### Before Updates
- Export study materials
- Backup `.env` file
- Note current Python version

---
