    "answer": "A linear linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains a data field and a pointer (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n*   **Nodes:** Composed of data and a pointer to the next node.\n*   **Linear:** Elements are arranged in a sequential order.\n*   **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink during runtime as needed.\n*   **No Fixed Size:** Unlike arrays, the size is not predetermined.\n*   **Pointer/Link:** The connection between nodes, storing the address of the next node.\n*   **Head:** Pointer to the first node in the list.\n*   **Tail:** The last node in the list, whose \"next\" pointer is usually `NULL` (or equivalent).\n*   **Insertion/Deletion:**  Efficient insertion and deletion of elements compared to arrays, especially in the middle of the list, as it only involves changing pointers.\n*   **Memory Allocation:** Dynamic, allocating memory for each node as needed.  This can sometimes lead to more memory overhead compared to arrays due to the storage of pointers.\n*   **Traversal:** Elements are accessed sequentially by following the pointers from one node to the next.  Direct access to an element (like in an array using an index) is not possible.\n\n**Suggestions for Further Study:**\n\n*   **Different Types of Linked Lists:** Explore singly linked lists (described above), doubly linked lists (nodes have pointers to both the next and previous nodes), and circular linked lists (the last node points back to the first node).\n*   **Implementations:** Practice implementing linked lists in different programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).\n*   **Applications:** Study common applications of linked lists, such as implementing stacks, queues, graphs, and hash tables.\n*   **Time Complexity:** Analyze the time complexity of common operations (insertion, deletion, search) on linked lists.\n",

It demonstrates the basic implementation of structures in C, including defining a structure named `Person` with fields for name, student ID, and CGPA, and then assigning and printing values for a variable of this structure type.\n",
