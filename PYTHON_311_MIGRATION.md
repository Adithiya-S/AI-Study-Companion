2. **`python3.11`** (Direct Python 3.11 command)
3. **`python311`** (Alternative naming)
4. **Specific paths:**
   - `C:\Python311\python.exe`
   - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe`
5. **Fallback to default `python`** (with warning)

## üìã User Experience Changes

### Before:
- Would use any Python version available
- Python 3.13 users would get errors
- No guidance on which Python version to use

### After:
- **Actively searches for Python 3.11**
- **Clear messages** when Python 3.11 detected
- **Specific warnings** for Python 3.13+
- **Download links** provided automatically
- **Multiple easy ways** to run with Python 3.11

---

## üöÄ How Users Should Run the App Now

### Best Method (Easiest):
```bash
run_python311.bat
```
Double-click this file - it handles everything!

### Alternative Methods:

**Using py launcher:**
```bash
py -3.11 main.py
```

**Using setup script:**
```bash
setup.bat
```
(Auto-detects Python 3.11)

**Using Java launcher:**
```bash
run_launcher.bat
```
(Java launcher finds Python 3.11)

## üí° Key Messages to Users

### ‚úÖ If You Have Python 3.11:
- **Everything works perfectly!**
- Use `run_python311.bat` or `py -3.11 main.py`
- All features including camera/eye tracking work

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If You Have Python 3.13:
- **Camera features WILL NOT WORK**
- MediaPipe is incompatible with Python 3.13+
- **Solution:** Install Python 3.11 (can coexist with 3.13)
- Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/

### üÜï If You Don't Have Python:
- **Install Python 3.11** (not the latest 3.13+)
- Use the link above
- Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Run `run_python311.bat`

## üîç What Happens in Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User has Python 3.11 ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Found Python 3.11 via py launcher
‚úÖ PERFECT: Python 3.11 detected - Optimal version!
Starting AI Study Companion...
[All features work]
```

### Scenario 2: User has Python 3.13 ‚ö†Ô∏è
```
[WARNING] Python 3.11 not found, using default Python
Detected Python 3.13.7
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Python 3.13+ is not officially supported
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED: Use Python 3.11 for full functionality
The app will attempt to run, but camera features will likely NOT work
```

### Scenario 3: User has Python 3.8-3.10 ‚úÖ
```
Detected Python 3.9.x

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Why Python 3.11 Specifically?

1. **MediaPipe Compatibility:**
   - MediaPipe (eye tracking library) has strict Python version requirements
   - Python 3.13 changed internal APIs that break MediaPipe
   - Python 3.11 is the last fully tested and stable version

2. **Dependency Stability:**
   - All dependencies (OpenCV, NumPy, etc.) work flawlessly on 3.11
   - No compatibility issues
   - Well-tested ecosystem

3. **Performance:**
   - Python 3.11 has performance improvements over 3.8-3.10
   - Stable and mature release
   - Long-term support

### What Changed in Python 3.13 That Breaks Things?

- Internal C API changes
- Modified memory management
- Changed extension module interface
- MediaPipe binary wheels don't support it yet
